How to export CSV profile
*************************

Here is one way of exporting your profiling results.

Once your profiling results are available, you do:
click on Incl Count Total so that functions are ordered by decreasing time
(right click)->data->export all
then export it with csv format (the only one available)

Then, open microsoft excel.
click on:
data->from text->
select your csv file
then, select the option "delimiter" instead of "fixed width"(My excel is in french, I don't know the exact terms in english)
click next
uncheck tab and check coma
next
finish
select insert data in new worksheet.
Then you can save it in whatever format you find most convenient. As an example, I provided a html version of my profile in this folder.
